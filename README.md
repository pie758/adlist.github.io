adlist.github.io
Adlist for pi-hole (or something like that).
Their might be a few domains that are invallaid. I will try to fix them, but it should not be much of a problem. 
paste the the url https://pie758.github.io/adlist.github.io into the adlist manager section. (this applys to pi-hole but i'm not sure with other programs.)
